$ ############ Transport-Chemistry Multi Model Include File ############

Replace_Symbols

TRCHEM  ""           $ Include transport chemistry code
XREAC  C             $ Include compositional components in chemical reactions

PERM3  ""            $ Include diagonal permeability tensor

$NUMTRCOF  19          $ Number of Jacobian coefficient blocks per equation
NUMTRCOF  7          $ Number of Jacobian coefficient blocks per equation

$$$$ the parameter NUMEQ is really obsolete for single,hydroi,hydroe,blacki
$$$$ it is kept in place for future use with the compositional model

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

MXNSPEC =  20        $ (MAX) number of chemical species present
MXFHIS = MXHISD    $ save number of history well points for flow
MXHISD = MXHISD + MXNSPEC   $ increase # of well pts by # species
MXTAB =  MXTAB * ( 1 + MXNSPEC ) $ increase number of tables by # species
NBCVARS = NBCVARS + 1

MXPHAST    3         $ (MAX) number of flowing phases  present

DIMRWK    1000      $  REAL WORK SPACE SIZE
DIMIWK    1000      $  INTEGER WORK SPACE SIZE
MXROCKTYPE  20      $  (MAX) NUMBER OF ROCK TYPES
